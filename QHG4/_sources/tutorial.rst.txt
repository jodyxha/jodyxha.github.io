QHG Tutorial
============

This tutorial explains how to implement populations, and how to compile and run QHG for them.

Preparations
------------
We assume you have downloaded the code for QHG4.

Make sure the environmental variable QHG4_DIR contains the full path to the top directory of QHG.

Next create a small directory tree for the tutorials in which all subdirectories contain the necessary data for one tutorial chapter.
To do this, use the script :ref:`build_tut_dirs.py<build_tut_dirs_ref>`.

.. code-block:: c++

    ${QHG4_DIR}/useful_stuff/build_tut_dirs.py tutorial

This will build the tutorial tree in the directory from which you call the script. Alternatively use a full path:

.. code-block:: c++

    ${QHG4_DIR}/useful_stuff/build_tut_dirs.py /data/QHG4/tutorial

In the tutorial we will refer to the directory you specified here as "top tutorial directory"


Tutorials
---------

In each chapter the code of increasingly complex population classes is described in detail.

All populations used in QHG are derived from :ref:`SPopulation<SPopulation_ref>`. The population classes usually have a constructor and override one or more methods.
 
must set QHG4_DIR to QHG root directory
