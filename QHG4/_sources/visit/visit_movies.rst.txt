Making movies from QDF files
============================

In order to make movies, you have to create files with numerical suffixes before the ``.qdf``:
For instance:

.. code-block:: bash

  tut_pop-grass_A_pop-sheep_P_SG_000000.qdf
  tut_pop-grass_A_pop-sheep_P_SG_000010.qdf
  tut_pop-grass_A_pop-sheep_P_SG_000020.qdf
     ...
  tut_pop_sapiens_SG_000000.qdf
  tut_pop_sapiens_SG_001000.qdf
  tut_pop_sapiens_SG_002000.qdf
     ...

VisIt will group such sequences of files in the "File open" dialog

Opening FIles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To load a group of file click on the "Open" button in the upper left of the control window:

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_file_grouped.png

Make sure that the drop-down list "File grouping" is set to "Smart".

Now click on one of the blocks, say the block "tut_pop-grass_A_pop-sheep_P_SG_*.qdf"
and press OK.

Specify what to visualize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can now start to set the plots and meshes you want to see as if there was only a single input file.
So you can follow the steps described in the :ref:`section for visualizing 2D data<visit_visualize_qdf_2D_ref>`.

At the end of this process you will see an image of the first file of the block.

Preview the movie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the buttons of the time control

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_time_control.png

you can
  - go one step back (left pointing arrow with bar)
  - play the movie backwards (left pointing arrow)
  - stop the movie (square)
  - play the movie forwards (rightt pointing arrow)
  - go one step ahead (right pointing arrow with bar)

Saving the movie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To save the movie in a video format such as MP4,
choose "Save movie ..." from the "file"-menu of the control window.

In the first dialog make sure the option "New simple movie" is selacted. 

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_movie_dlg01.png

Press "Next >".

In the second dialog, you have to select the movie format.

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_movie_dlg02.png

We choose "MPEG Movie" in the "Format" drop-down list nand press the right-pointing arrow "->" in the middle of the dial0g.
The enrty "MPEG movie" should appear in the list on the right hand side. Press "Next >".

In this dialog you can select at which speed the movie should play, and wether to start with first and end with the last frame or not.

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_movie_dlg03.png

Press "Next>".

In the new diqalog specify an output directory and a base file name, The base file name is used to name the png images of the frames, and for the name of the finished movie.

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_movie_dlg04.png

Press "Next>".

In this dialog make sure "No" is selected (i.e., we don't want to be notifiedby email).

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_movie_dlg05.png

Press "Next>".

In the final dialog, leave "Now, use currently allocated processes" selected.

   .. figure:: ../../images/visit_movie_dlg06.png


Press "Finish".

Now VisIt loops through all images, creates PNG files and combines them in a movie file.

You can practice movie-making by selectng the other block ("tut_pop_sapiens_SG_*.qdf") and going through the same steps as above.
