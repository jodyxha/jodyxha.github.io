Building the QDF Format Plugin
==============================

In order to enable VisIt to read and interpret out QDF files. we had to implement a plugin for this.

The plugin code must be compiled with the tools Visit wa compiled with.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build script for the plugin ``Build_PLUGIN.sh`` expects the environment variables XML2CMAKE_BIN and CMAKE_VISIT to be set to the corresponding binaries.
The best way is to export these variables in a script that will be executed whenever a shell starts, in bash that would be ``~/.bashrc``.

In this file add the lines

.. code-block:: bash

    export XML2CMAKE_BIN=/opt/visit_3.3.2/bin/xml2cmake
    export CMAKE_VISIT=/opt/visit_3.3_sources/cmake-3.18.2/bin/cmake

and then type

.. code-block:: bash

    . ~/bash_rc

to activate the changes for the current terminal.

Compiling the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the QHG code tree, go to the qdf format plugin directory and run the script ``BUILD_PLUGIN.sh``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ${QHG4_DIR}/visit_plugins/qdfformat/

    ./BUILD_PLUGIN.sh 

Once the compiling of the plugin is finished, you can open QDF files in VisIt and display various plots 
(open a file, then add the pseudocolor plot you want to display).
