Coastal
=======

This tool finds coastal cells (land cells with water in a given neighborhood) with a brute force search and marks corresponding cells in the m_adWater array of the Geography group in a QDF file. 

Code: `Coastal.cpp <https://github.com/jodyxha/QHG4/blob/main/QHG4/import/Coastal.cpp>`_


Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

  ${QHG4_DIR}/import/Coastal -i <input_qdf> -d <distance> -o <output_qdf>

where

``input_qdf``
    a qdf file with a Geography (Altitude) group in which to search for coastal cells.

``distance``
    maximum distance to sea (in cell hops).

``output_qdf``
     output file (coastal written to DS 'Coastal' in the 'Geography' group.)

Algorithm
---------
* loop through all cells ``C`` in the input file's grid.
* if ``C`` has positive altitude then
    * loop through all cells ``N`` in a ``d``-distabce of  ``C``
    * if ``N`` has  negative altitude then
        * set ``m_adCoastal[i]`` to 1 (where ``i`` is the index of ``C``)
        * exit loop
    * endif
* end loop
* write QDF file
