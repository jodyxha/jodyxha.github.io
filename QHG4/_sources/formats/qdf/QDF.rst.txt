The QDF Format
==============

.. rst-class:: hidden

   This page describes the :index:`QDF file format`

Most input files and all output files for QHG4 have the **QDF** file format.
QDF is a subset of the `HDF5 file format <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5>`_, which is widely used to manage large datasets of scientific data.

HDF has a hierarchical structure of so-called *groups*. The top level group is designated with "/".
Every group can contain other groups, as well as *attributes* and *data sets*.

QDF uses groups to store :ref:`environmental data <Environment_ov_ref>` as well as population data, and attributes to hold the parameters of a population's :ref:`action <Actions_ov_ref>`.

The structure of QDF
--------------------


Groups
^^^^^^
The top level of a qdf file can contain the following groups:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  GridGroup
  GeoGroup
  ClimateGroup
  VegGroup
  NavGroup
  PopsGroup 
   
Apart from "Populations", all groups contain only data sets and attributes. "Populations" contains one group for each species involved.
  

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^
The top level of a qdf file usually contains the attributes

- **QHG**
    Contains the string "A QHG4 Data File"

- **Step**
    For output files, the alue of this attribute is the simulation step for which the qdf file is wwritten.

- **StartTime** 
    The starting time of the simulation (e.g. "-75000").  

- **Info**
    Arbitrary information

The root may have additional attributes but generally, they are ignored.
