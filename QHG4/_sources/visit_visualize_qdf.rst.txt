Visualize QDF files with VisIt
==============================

Visit has a large variety of plots such as pseudocolor plots, vector plots. 
Every plot needs a particular set of data, so it can not plot any dataset.

For the QDF data produced by QHG4 we mostly do mesh plots (for meshes and individuals) and pseudocolor plots (for value fields).

The example qdf files used here can be found in the subdirectory ``tutorial_data/example_qdf`` of the QHG root directory.

When you start visit

.. code-block:: bash

    ./visit

You will see two windows, a control window to the left, and a plot window on the right.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_layout.png

Opening Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To load a QDF file click on the "Open" button on the upper left of the control window,
This will open a file dialog:

.. figure:: ../images/visit_file_grouped.png

Notice that some files are bundled into groups. 
VisIt does this to make it possible to load an entire group of similarly named files (e.g. to make an animation or a movie).

To get rid of the grouping, click on the drop down list "File Grouping" and select "Off".

Visualizing 2D data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now select a qdf file containing 2D data by double clicking it, for instance ``tut_pop-grass_A_pop-sheep-P_SG_004960.qdf`` (this file comes from a simulation where mobile sheep
eat stationary grass. When there is no grass available in a cell, the sheep will starve unless it finds another cell with grass). 

Notice that in the control dialog, the button "Add" (middle left) is now active.
Clicking this button you see all generally available plots, but not all of them are able to handle QDF data.

To start with, select "Mesh", and from the pop-up menu choose "Sheep"

.. figure:: ../images/visit_menu_mesh.png

If you click on the button "Draw", you see the sheep agents as black dots.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_2D_grid.png

Next, we add a pseudocolor plot for the available grass.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_menu_pseudocolor.png

By default, the palette for pseudocolors plots goes from blue (low values) over green to red (high values).

Ater pressing on "Draw", you'll notice that the pseudocolor plot is visible, but the sheep have vanished.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_2D_pseudocolor.png

To see both the sheep and the availabla grass, you have to change the order of the plots:
Do a right-click on the sheep plot in the dialog's list, and from there select "Move towards last"

.. figure:: ../images/visit_plot_move.png

And now enjoy the result:

.. figure:: ../images/visit_2D_finished.png
  
You can toggle between showing a plot and hiding it by selecting it in the list in the dialog and pressing the button "Hide/Show".
To completely remove a plot, select it and press "Delete".

Visualizing 3D data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open a file dialog by pressing "Open", and if the files appear grouped, ungroup them (see above how to do that).
Then select a 3D data file, such as ``tut_pop-sapiens_SG_005000.png``, press "Add" and select "sapiens" from the submenu of the Mesh plot. and then press "Draw".

This produces a 3D plot of all agents found in the data. You can rotate the plot by dragging the mouse around the plot window.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_3D_grid_bw.png

Let's change the color of the agents now. Do a double-click on the mesh plot in the list to open the mesh plot attributes.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_grid_color.png

In the upper left of the dialog activate the radio button "Custom" and click on the rectangle beside it. 
In the small color selector choose a bright color, e.g. yellow, then click on "Apply" in the lower left corner, 
then "Dismiss" in the lower right corner to hide the dialog.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_3D_grid_color.png

To plot the earth itself we will use the altitude values.

Click on "Add" and select "Altitude" from the "Pseudocolor" submenu, then press "Draw".

.. figure:: ../images/visit_pseudocolor_bad.png

You see a sphere, but it seems the default palette is not very useful here.
We'll use a color map we created to display altitudes better.

So double-click on the Altitude plot in the list. 

.. figure:: ../images/visit_3D_attributes.png

In the plot attribute dialog, set "Minimum" to -6000 and "Maximum" to 6000 (you may have to click the checkboxes to eneble the text fields),
and click on the big button in the middle of the dialog (initially this is labeled "Default"). In the pop-up list locate geo2 and click it.

.. figure:: ../images/visit_pseudocolor_color.png


Then press on "Apply" , and "Dismiss" to hide the dialog.
