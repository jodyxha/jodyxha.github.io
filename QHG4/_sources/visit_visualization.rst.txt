Visualizing QDF files with VisIt
================================

`VisIt <https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website>`_ is an Open Source, interactive, scalable, visualization, animation and analysis tool hosted on github.
It supports many file formats, but since the file structure of QDF files is homegrown, we had to implement a plugin which enables VisIt to read QDF files.
