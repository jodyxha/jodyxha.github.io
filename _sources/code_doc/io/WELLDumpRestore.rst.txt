   This page gives an overview of the module :index:`WELLDumpRestorefile formats`


This module contains only two functions to deal with dumping and restoring the internal state of the randomm number generator :ref:`WELL512<WELL512_ref>`. 

Public Functions
----------------

``dumpWELL``
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: c++

    int dumpWELL(WELL512 **apWELL, int iNumWELL, const std::string sOwner, hid_t hSpeciesGroup);

Dump the internal state of the random number generators.

``apWELL``
    Array of pointers to the RWNGs.

``iNumWELL``
    Number of RNGs in the array.

``sOwner``
    Name of the owner (e.g. species name for the population's RNGS, or action name ofr specific actions like genetocs) or any other identifying string.

``hSpeciesGroup``
    HDF handle to the group for this species.

The data will be written as attributes to the species group.

Returns 0 on succes, -1 on failure.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``restoreWELL``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: c++

    int restoreWELL(WELL512 **apWELL, int iNumWELL, const std::string sOwner, hid_t hSpeciesGroup);

Restore the internal state of the random number generators.

``apWELL``
    Array of pointers to the RNGs.

``iNumWELL``
    Number of RNGs in the array.

``sOwner``
    Name of the owner (e.g. species name for the population's RNGS, or action name ofr specific actions like genetocs) or any other identifying string. IMPORTANT: must be the same name as the one used with the dump command.

``hSpeciesGroup``
    HDF handle to the group for this species.

Returns 0 on succes, -1 on failure.
