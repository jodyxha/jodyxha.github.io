tut_StaticPop
=============

.. rst-class:: hidden

   This page describes the class :index:`tutStaticPop`

The class ``tut_StaticPop`` is derived from :ref:`SPopulation<SPopulation_ref>`. I is the simplest and most trivial population class in QHG: it does nothing - agents don move, die or give birth.
According to the `Talking Heads <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZpZuIWu1tw>` this is heaven...

Since this class is so simple, its implementation is, too: it only implements a constructor.
It also does not define its own agent class - it uses the agents defined for ``SPopulation``.


(The class ``tut_StaticPop`` is described in detail in the :ref:first part<TutorialStatic_ref>`  of the :ref:`tutorial<Tutorial_ref>`).

Code: `tut_StaticPop.h <https://github.com/jodyxha/QHG4/blob/main/QHG4/populations/tut_StaticPop.h>`_, `tut_StaticPop.cpp <https://github.com/jodyxha/QHG4/blob/main/QHG4/populations/tut_StaticPop.cpp>`_


Public Methods
--------------

``constructor``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: c++

    tut_StaticPop(SCellGrid *pCG, PopFinder *pPopFinder, int iLayerSize, 
                  IDGen **apIDG, uint32_t *aulState, uint *aiSeeds);

``pCG``
    Pointer to the :ref:`cell grid<SCellGrid_ref>`  the simulation runs on.

``pPopFinder``
    A pointer to an instance of a :ref:`PopFinder<PopFinder_ref>` population container.

``iLayerSize``
    The layer size used by the :ref:`agent management system <AgentManagement_ref>`.

``apIDG``
    An array of pointers to the :ref:`ID generators<IDGen_ref>`, one for each thread.

``aulState``
    An array of ``uint`` used to initalize the :ref:`WELL512 random number generators<WELL512_ref>`.

``aiSeeds``
    Seeds for other WELL512 instances **not used for moving and breeding**, e.g. for genetics. 

All this constructor does is to call the constructor of its parent class ``SPopulation``.
