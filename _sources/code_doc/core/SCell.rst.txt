    This page describes the struct :index:`SCell`

The ``SCell``  represents a single node of the :ref:`cell grid<SCellGrid_ref>`.

Code: `SCell.h <https://github.com/jodyxha/QHG4/blob/main/QHG4/core/SCell.h>`_ 


This is the declaration of the ``SCell`` struct:

.. code-block:: c++

    typedef struct {
        gridtype  m_iGlobalID;
        uchar   m_iNumNeighbors;
        int     m_aNeighbors[MAX_NEIGH];
    } SCell;

``m_iGlobalID``
    The cell ID (in single-processor situations the id is equal to the index in the array).

``m_iNumNeighbors``
    Actual number of neighbors of this cell (in icosahedral grids 12 nodes have only 5 neighbors each).

``m_aNeighbors``
    Array of indexes of each cell's neighbors (if num neighbors is less then MAX_NEIGH, the remaining elements are set to -1).
