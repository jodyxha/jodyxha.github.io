   This page describes :index:`geography group`

The **geography group** contains data and attributes pertaining to geography, such as coordinates, altitudes, sea levele ice coverage etc.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

- **NumCells**
    Number of grid cells.

- **MaxNeigh**
    Maximium number of neighbors for nodes.

- **Radius**
    Earth radius (0 for LTC grids).

- **SeaLevel**
    Sea level (difference to present-day sea level).


DataSets
^^^^^^^^

**Longitude**
    An array contining the longitude for each node.

**Latitude**
    An array contining the latitude for each node.

**Altitude**
    An array containing the altitude (above sealevel) for each node.

**Water**
    Array of fresh water ampouns (rivers) for each cell.

**IceCover**
    Array of bools, true if the corresponding node is covered with ice.

**Coastal**
    Array of bools, true if the corresponding node is close to the coast

**Distances**    
    An array of size ``NumCells*MacNeighbors``, where ``Distances[MaxNeighbors*i + j]`` is the distance from node i to its neighbor number j.
